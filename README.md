## Backstory

- This is my first ever CLI tool, so i was Learning about Networking and Subnetting Concepts in College, so i thought why not create a CIDR info generator since we had to do it manually to solve it everytime and didn't even know if it was correct or not so i gave it a try.  
- I wrote everything in python, even though i don't use python, generally i use C and C++.  
- The Python code i didn't do any improvement, i just wanted it to work. so i just wrote python code for it, it took some hours.  
- The Problem was i didn't knew how to write a command line tool so i had to use AI for it but, i'll learn it later.
